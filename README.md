The ultimate goal for this project is the creation of an application to track my workouts. It has the secondary purpose of serving as an information database for exercises.

One part of this program is functional: the exercise database.

I'm currently mapping out the actual workout logging portion of the application.

The exercise information within the database is borrowed from [API Ninjas](https://www.api-ninjas.com), using their exercise API.


## Requirements

Authenticity Fitness requires the following python library.
